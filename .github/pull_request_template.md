IMPORTANT!!

DO NOT file a PR for modules that are not yours!
You should contact the 3rd party module author/maintainer instead.

The UnrealIRCd team only accepts changes from the module maintainer.
We cannot judge PR's on the maintainer's behalf. All changes,
small or big, must come from the module maintainer to maintain
a clear division of responsibilities. 

Only file a PR if:
* You are the maintainer of the existing module, OR
* You are submitting a new module and have read
  https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Rules_for_3rd_party_modules_in_unrealircd-contrib

Thanks!
